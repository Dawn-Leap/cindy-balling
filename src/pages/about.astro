                            Hi, I'm Cindy and I am a diabetes reversal
                            specialist! I am passionate about helping people
                            with diabetes live their best life. It has been so
                            hard for me to see many of my family members
                            struggle with diabetes. I understand what you might
                            be going through. My mission is to help everyone
                            achieve a healthy lifestyle. Please join my coaching
                            program, sign up for my regular diabetes
                            discussions, or browse around this website to learn
                            more. You can change your life and reach your goals.

                            Lifestyle medicine is a science-based approach to
                            preventing, treating, and even reversing diseases by
                            replacing unhealthy behaviors with positive ones,
                            such as eating healthfully, being physically active,

                            My diabetes reversal program, emphasizes the role of
                            diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes in managing
                            and potentially reversing diabetes. Unlike other
                            programs, this program dives deeper into the root
                            causes of diabetes and how to specifically address
                            them in ways that are safe and most effective.
                            Participants will learn how to eat healthily without
                            riding the roller coaster of blood sugar ups and
                            downs.

                            radical health advice may produce results in the
                            short term, but those results vanish when the
                            program ends. A lifestyle medicine coach will teach
                            you the proper way to make lifestyle changes that
                            stick. Everything I teach is based on credible, well
